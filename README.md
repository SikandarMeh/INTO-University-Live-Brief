Your task
INTO University Partnerships are considering expansion of their portfolio in the USA, and would like to target potential new partner universities/colleges who fit the following criteria. 
The universities must be located in a state:
Which is proven to be highly attractive to international students
Where INTO does not currently have a university partner (you can find the universities INTO has already partnered with here)
With a relatively affordable price point for undergraduate study

INTO would prefer that the institutions present an opportunity for recruiting international students at scale. Indicators of this include:
University currently has a low percentage of international students compared to State benchmarks
University has demonstrated poor growth in international student enrollments for a minimum of three years
University has an attractive price point for students coming from more price sensitive backgrounds
